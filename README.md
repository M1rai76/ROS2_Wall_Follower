# ü§ñ Wall-Following Robot Navigation System

This project uses the **ROS2 Framework**, **OpenCV**, **Nav2**, **Gazebo**, and **Cartographer** to develop an autonomous navigation system for a TurtleBot3 robot. The robot autonomously follows walls, detects and localizes color-coded markers, and navigates all while visualizing its path and detected markers in RViz. The project demonstrates the integration of advanced robotic navigation concepts, computer vision techniques, and simulation tools. TurtleBot3 was chosen as the robotic platform due to its compatibility with ROS2 and its well-documented resources. **Reference**: [TurtleBot3 Overview and Documentation](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/).

## üåü Features

### 1. üöß Autonomous Wall-Following
   - Implements a **left-wall following** algorithm to guide the robot through a maze.
   - Uses TurtleBot3‚Äôs sensor data to maintain a stable distance from walls, ensuring smooth navigation.
   - **Reference**: [TurtleBot3 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3)

### 2. üéØ Marker Detection with OpenCV
   - Uses **OpenCV** and **linear regression** to estimate the distance and shape of color-coded markers.
   - Differentiates markers based on unique color combinations (e.g., pink on green, blue on pink).
   - Publishes marker positions to the `/marker_position` topic for further processing.

### 3. üåç Marker Position Transformation
   - Converts marker positions from the **camera frame** to the **map frame** using **tf2**, ensuring accurate localization.
   - Publishes transformed positions as a `MarkerArray`, enabling real-time visualization in RViz.
   - **Reference**: Learn more about [tf2 Transformations](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Tf2.html).

### 4. üß≠ Path Planning with Nav2
   - Uses **Nav2** for advanced path planning and obstacle avoidance.
   - Allows the robot to navigate from one marker to another in a predefined sequence.
   - Users can interactively set goals in RViz by clicking on markers, enabling flexible and dynamic navigation.
   - **Reference**: Explore the [Nav2 Documentation](https://navigation.ros.org/).

### 5. üñ•Ô∏è Simulation in Gazebo
   - Simulates the robot and its environment in **Gazebo**, allowing realistic testing of navigation algorithms in a virtual maze.
   - Provides an efficient way to test and refine algorithms before deployment on physical robots.
   - **Reference**: [Gazebo Documentation](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials)

### 6. üó∫Ô∏è Mapping with Cartographer
   - Integrates **Cartographer** for 2D SLAM, allowing the robot to create a real-time map of its environment while navigating.
   - Displays the generated map in RViz alongside the robot‚Äôs path and detected markers.
   - **Reference**: [Cartographer Documentation](https://google-cartographer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

### 1. Wall-Following Node
   - Implements left-wall following behavior using sensor data, enabling autonomous maze navigation.

### 2. Marker Detection (`see_marker` Node)
   - Processes images from the TurtleBot3 Pi camera to detect and identify color-coded markers.
   - Publishes marker positions to the `/marker_position` topic.

### 3. Coordinate Transformation (`point_transformer` Node)
   - Subscribes to `/marker_position` to retrieve detected marker positions.
   - Transforms marker coordinates to the `map` frame using tf2 for accurate display in RViz.
   - Publishes transformed marker positions as a `MarkerArray`.

### 4. Nav2 Path Planning
   - Reads marker positions and their sequence from a configuration file and generates a path for the robot to follow.
   - Integrates ROS2‚Äôs Nav2 stack to autonomously navigate between markers and avoid obstacles.
